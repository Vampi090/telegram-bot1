# Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring changes made to improve the project's architecture and code organization. The main goal was to separate concerns, improve maintainability, and make the code more modular.

## Architecture Changes

### Before Refactoring

The original architecture had several issues:

1. **Tight coupling**: Handlers directly accessed the database, mixing UI logic with data access
2. **Lack of separation of concerns**: Business logic, data access, and UI were all mixed together
3. **Code duplication**: Database connection code was repeated in multiple places
4. **No clear data models**: Data was passed around as tuples without clear structure

### After Refactoring

The new architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Handlers Layer** (`handlers/`): Responsible for UI interactions and user flow
2. **Service Layer** (`services/`): Contains business logic and orchestrates operations
3. **Data Access Layer** (`services/database_service.py`): Centralizes database operations
4. **Model Layer** (`models/`): Defines data structures and their behaviors

## New Components

### 1. Transaction Model

Created `models/transaction.py` to represent transaction data with proper encapsulation and helper methods:

- Properties for transaction attributes (id, user_id, amount, category, etc.)
- Factory method to create from database tuples
- Conversion methods (to_dict, __str__)
- Automatic type determination based on amount

### 2. Transaction Database Functions

Added transaction-related functions to `services/database_service.py`:

- `add_transaction`: Adds a new transaction to the database
- `get_transaction_history`: Retrieves transaction history for a user
- `filter_transactions_by_category_or_type`: Filters transactions by category or type
- `get_last_transaction`: Gets the last transaction for a user
- `delete_transaction`: Deletes a transaction by ID

### 3. Transaction Service

Created `services/transaction_service.py` to handle business logic:

- Acts as an intermediary between handlers and database
- Converts between database tuples and Transaction objects
- Provides a clean API for transaction operations
- Handles error cases and validation

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to one layer don't affect others
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Database code is centralized
3. **Better Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
4. **Cleaner Handler Code**: Handlers focus only on UI interactions
5. **Easier to Extend**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
6. **Better Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across the application
7. **Type Safety**: Using proper objects instead of tuples reduces errors

## Future Improvements

1. Implement similar refactoring for other modules (budget, analytics, etc.)
2. Add unit tests for each layer
3. Consider using a dependency injection pattern for services
4. Add more robust error handling and logging
5. Consider using an ORM for database operations
